			My most prominent experience serving is my time at Friends of North Richmond. There I worked as a vocal instructor, providing free vocal education to underprivileged children in the Richmond area. Working under Cornelia Post, I mainly oversaw kids who had questions or fell behind the general instruction. It was a wonderful experience in which I was able to make many wonderful friends as well as help those who are less fortunate than I.
			<br>
			<br>
			I also have spent a great deal of time working with East Fort Bend Human Needs Ministry distributing food to the less privileged as well as transporting food from donators to the ministry. Of the two, distributing the food was by far my favorite as I really enjoyed getting to meet the people that I was helping personally. Especially when I was younger, I am sure that this experience has helped me to become the compassionate person that I am today.
